# Impedance Measurement Project

## Overview

This project is a part of a coursework assignment at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The application is designed to measure the impedance module and phase of a two-terminal network using the three-voltmeter method. The project is developed using LabVIEW, which provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for data acquisition and analysis.

## Features

- **Impedance Measurement**: Accurately measures the impedance module and phase.
- **LabVIEW Implementation**: Developed using LabVIEW for efficient data acquisition and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy operation.
